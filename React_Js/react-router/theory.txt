what is router in react js?
React Router is used to implement routing in React applications. It is a collection of navigational components within your application. 
it is  arouting and navigation library in react js .

In v6.4, new routers were introduced that support the new data APIs:

createBrowserRouter
createMemoryRouter
createHashRouter
createStaticRouter 

The following routers do not support the data APIs:

<BrowserRouter>
<MemoryRouter>
<HashRouter>
<NativeRouter>
<StaticRouter>



starting with BrowserRouter:
A <BrowserRouter> stores the current location in the browser's address bar using clean URLs and navigates using the browser's built-in history stack.


MemoryRouter:
A <MemoryRouter> stores its locations internally in an array. Unlike <BrowserHistory> and <HashHistory>, 
it isn't tied to an external source, like the history stack in a browser. 
This makes it ideal for scenarios where you need complete control over the history stack, like testing.

HashRouter:
<HashRouter> is for use in web browsers when the URL should not (or cannot) be sent to the server for some reason.

StaticRouter:
<StaticRouter> is used to render a React Router web app in node. Provide the current location via the location prop.
