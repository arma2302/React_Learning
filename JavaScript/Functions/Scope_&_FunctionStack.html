      The Call Stack The Stack is a mechanism for interpreted languages, like
      Javascript, which keeps track of a machine’s place in a script and
      represents the static memory of a machine. Snippets of code are are queued
      in a First-In, Last-Out order. Think of it like stacking boxes. We won’t
      be able to remove the first box until we remove any boxes we later placed
      on top of that box and we will have to search the top box before we can
      search the ones below. This is important to keep in mind as we explore the
      way our programs organize and access data.

      <script>
        class stack {
          constructor() {
            this.item = [];
          }

          push(number) {
            this.item.push(number);
          }
          pop() {
            if (this.item.length === 0);
            {
              return "call stack is empty;";
            }
            return this.item.pop();
          }

          peek() {
            return this.item[this.item.length - 1];
          }
          isEmpty() {
            return this.item.length === 0;
          }
          size() {
            return this.item.length;
          }
        }

        let myCallstack = new stack();
        myCallstack.push(5);
        myCallstack.push(10);
        console.log(myCallstack.peek());
        console.log(myCallstack.size());
      </script>
