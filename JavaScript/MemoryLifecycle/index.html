    <h2>Memory lifecycle</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>memory allocation</li>
      <li>using the allocated memory</li>
      <li>Releasing the memory when not in use anymore.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>stack and Heap Memory</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        all the primitves data typrs uses stack memory,size is known at the
        compile time,allocated a fixed ammount of memory
      </li>
      <li>
        non-primitves data types uses heap memory,size is knowon at the run
        time,no limit to the ammount of memory
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>JavaScript garbage collection</h2>
    <p>
      We have known how the allocation of memory works. Where JavaScript stores
      its memory. But the memory life cycle which we discussed previously, shows
      that there is one last step; releasing the memory when not in use. This
      process is handled automatically by JavaScript i.e the JavaScript garbage
      collector takes care of this.
