    <h2>Axios</h2>
    <p>
      Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from
      the client-side. It offers a concise and intuitive way to send
      asynchronous HTTP requests to web servers, enabling developers to avoid
      having to write hundreds of lines of code to accomplish the same thing.
      The main advantages of Axios include ease of use, built-in features, and
      compatibility with both browser and Node.js environments.
