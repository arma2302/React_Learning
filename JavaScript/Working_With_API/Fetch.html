    <h1>Fetch in javascript</h1>
    <p>
      The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests and
      processing the responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fetch is promise-based and is integrated with features of the modern web
      such as service workers and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
    </p>
    <p>
      The fetch() function returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response
      object representing the server's response. You can then check the request
      status and extract the body of the response in various formats, including
      text and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response.
