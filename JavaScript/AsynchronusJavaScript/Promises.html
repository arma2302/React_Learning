    <h1>promises</h1>
    <p>promises are used to handle multiple asynchronus operations</p>
    <p>to avoid the problem of call back hell and more code readability</p>
    <p>used to fethc web-api</p>
    <p>
      It is a way of saying, “I don’t have this value right now, but I will have
      it later.”
    </p>
    <p>
      a promise lets you keep working with your code while waiting for something
      else to finish, like loading data from a server. When the data is ready,
      the promise will deliver it.
    </p>
    <h2>How does it Works?</h2>
    <p>Three state :pending,fullfilled and rejected</p>
    <p>
      Pending: The promise is waiting for something to finish. For example,
      waiting for data to load from a website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fulfilled: The promise has been completed successfully. The data you were
      waiting for is now available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rejected: The promise has failed. Maybe there was a problem, like the
      server not responding.
