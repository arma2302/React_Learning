    <h1>Callback Hell</h1>
    <p>
      Callback hell in JavaScript, often referred to as the "pyramid of doom,"
      occurs when multiple nested callbacks create complex and hard-to-maintain
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Difficult to read due to deep nesting and indentation, forming a “pyramid
      of doom.”
    </p>
    <p>Hard to maintain and update due to complex, nested structure.</p>
    <p>
      Difficult to debug, as tracing errors through deeply nested callbacks is
      challenging.
