      typesArray are mostly used fundamental Data stucture. are like normal
      arrays but it allows to read and write raw binary Data
    </p>
    <p>each element in a typedArray is a raw binary data</p>
    <p>two main components buffer and views</p>
    <p>
      buffers can be implemented using array buffer objects and the object
      represent the chunk of data. and to read ,write and manipulate the data we
      need a view.
    </p>
    <p>typed array methods</p>
    <p>
      Array buffer nothing but just a representation of object of a fixed lenht
      binar Data, it is a actual storage of bytes
    </p>
    <p>
      array buffer and typedArray are designed fr the high performance
      operations.more sufficiant than working with the javaScript's traditional
      data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ArrayBuffer provides a way to manage memory directly. You can create a
      buffer of a specific size and work with it directly, which is useful for
      low-level data manipulation or when working with large data sets.
